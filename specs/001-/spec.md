# Feature Specification: Task Management & Visualization Browser Extension

**Feature Branch**: `001-`
**Created**: 2025-10-11
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "할 일 관리와 할 일 및 완료된 일 정보를 기반으로 시각화 해주는 웹 익스텐션을 개발할거야. 새 탭을 교체해서 보여주는 형태로 제공될거고, 메인 화면에는 태스크 추가 및 제거와 대시보드 뷰가 존재할거야."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Quick Task Capture (Priority: P1)

Users can quickly add tasks whenever they open a new browser tab, capturing to-dos immediately without switching contexts or opening separate applications.

**Why this priority**: Core value proposition - if users can't easily add tasks, the extension fails its primary purpose. This is the minimum viable product.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by opening a new tab, adding a task with a title, and verifying it persists when closing and reopening tabs.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the user opens a new browser tab, **When** they type a task title and press Enter (or click Add), **Then** the task appears in the task list immediately
2. **Given** a task has been added, **When** the user opens a new tab again, **Then** the previously added task is still visible
3. **Given** the user is viewing their task list, **When** they click the delete/remove button on a task, **Then** the task is removed from the list immediately
4. **Given** the user has no tasks, **When** they open a new tab, **Then** they see an empty state with clear instructions to add their first task

### User Story 2 - Task Completion Tracking (Priority: P2)

Users can mark tasks as complete to track their progress and build a history of accomplished work, providing motivation and accountability.

**Why this priority**: Essential for task management but builds on P1. Users need the ability to add tasks first before they can complete them.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by adding several tasks, marking some as complete, and verifying that completed tasks are visually distinguished and tracked separately.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the user has active tasks, **When** they click/check a task to mark it complete, **Then** the task is visually marked as completed (e.g., strikethrough, different styling)
2. **Given** a task is marked complete, **When** the user opens a new tab, **Then** the completed task remains in its completed state
3. **Given** the user has completed tasks, **When** they view the task list, **Then** they can see both active and completed tasks [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should completed tasks be in a separate section, hidden by default, or mixed with active tasks?]
4. **Given** a task is marked complete, **When** the user changes their mind, **Then** they can unmark/uncomplete the task to return it to active status

### User Story 3 - Progress Visualization Dashboard (Priority: P3)

Users can view visual representations of their task completion patterns and productivity trends, gaining insights into their work habits and maintaining motivation.

**Why this priority**: Adds value through insights but not required for basic task management. Can be delivered after core functionality is solid.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by creating and completing multiple tasks over time, then viewing the dashboard to verify that visualizations accurately reflect task completion data.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the user has completed tasks, **When** they view the dashboard section, **Then** they see visual charts/graphs showing their productivity metrics
2. **Given** the user has task history, **When** they access the dashboard, **Then** they see metrics such as total tasks completed, completion rate, and [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What time period should metrics cover - daily, weekly, monthly, all-time, or configurable?]
3. **Given** the dashboard is displayed, **When** the user adds or completes tasks, **Then** the visualizations update to reflect the new data
4. **Given** the user has no task history, **When** they view the dashboard, **Then** they see a helpful empty state explaining that visualizations will appear once they complete tasks

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the user has hundreds of tasks? (Performance and scrolling behavior)
- What happens when the user clears browser data? (Data persistence and recovery)
- What happens if the user opens multiple tabs simultaneously? (Data synchronization)
- What happens when a task title is extremely long? (Text truncation and display)
- What happens if the user tries to add an empty task? (Validation)
- How does the extension handle data migration if the data structure changes in future versions?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: Extension MUST replace the default new tab page with the task management interface
- **FR-002**: Users MUST be able to add new tasks with a title/description
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to delete/remove tasks from their list
- **FR-004**: Users MUST be able to mark tasks as complete
- **FR-005**: Users MUST be able to unmark completed tasks to return them to active status
- **FR-006**: System MUST persist all task data locally so tasks survive browser restarts
- **FR-007**: System MUST display a dashboard view showing task completion visualizations
- **FR-008**: Dashboard MUST show at minimum: total tasks, completed tasks, and completion rate
- **FR-009**: System MUST sync task data across all browser tabs in real-time
- **FR-010**: System MUST handle empty states gracefully (no tasks, no completed tasks, no data for visualizations)
- **FR-011**: Task input MUST validate that tasks have non-empty titles
- **FR-012**: System MUST provide visual distinction between active and completed tasks
- **FR-013**: Extension MUST be installable in [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Which browsers - Chrome only, Chrome + Firefox, or Chrome + Firefox + Edge?]

### Key Entities

- **Task**: Represents a single to-do item. Attributes include unique identifier, title/description, completion status (active/completed), creation timestamp, completion timestamp (if completed), and display order
- **Dashboard Metrics**: Aggregated statistics derived from tasks. Includes total task count, completed task count, completion rate percentage, and time-based metrics for visualization

### Assumptions

- Tasks are stored locally in browser storage (no cloud sync or account system)
- Tasks are single-level (no subtasks or nested hierarchies)
- Tasks do not have due dates, priorities, tags, or categories in the MVP
- Visualizations use standard chart types (bar charts, line graphs, pie charts)
- Extension works in modern browser versions (last 2 major versions)
- One user per browser profile (no multi-user support)
- Tasks persist indefinitely (no automatic archival or deletion)

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Users can add a new task within 3 seconds of opening a new tab
- **SC-002**: Task list displays immediately (under 500ms) when opening a new tab
- **SC-003**: Extension handles at least 1000 tasks without performance degradation (smooth scrolling, instant updates)
- **SC-004**: Dashboard visualizations render within 1 second even with 1000+ tasks
- **SC-005**: 90% of users successfully add their first task within 30 seconds of installing the extension
- **SC-006**: Task data persists across browser restarts with 100% reliability
- **SC-007**: Changes to tasks (add, complete, delete) synchronize across all open tabs within 1 second
- **SC-008**: Users can understand the purpose and usage of the extension without external documentation (intuitive UI)
