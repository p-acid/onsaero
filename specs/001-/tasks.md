# Tasks: Task Management & Visualization Browser Extension

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: Not explicitly requested in feature specification - implementing without test tasks per user requirements

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- **Chrome extension (single project)**: `src/`, `supabase/`, `public/` at repository root
- Paths follow structure from plan.md

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and Chrome extension structure

- [X] T001 Install Chrome extension dependencies (@crxjs/vite-plugin, @vanilla-extract/vite-plugin, @tanstack/react-query, zustand, recharts, @supabase/supabase-js)
- [X] T002 [P] Configure Vite for Chrome extension with @crxjs/vite-plugin in vite.config.ts
- [X] T003 [P] Create Chrome extension manifest.json in src/ with new tab override and permissions
- [X] T004 [P] Create newtab.html entry point in project root
- [X] T005 [P] Setup vanilla-extract theme system in src/styles/theme.css.ts
- [X] T006 [P] Configure Biome linting and formatting for extension development

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core infrastructure that MUST be complete before ANY user story can be implemented

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

- [ ] T007 Setup Supabase project and get credentials for .env configuration
- [ ] T008 Create Supabase database schema in supabase/migrations/001_initial_schema.sql (tasks, daily_metrics, user_preferences tables)
- [ ] T009 [P] Create TypeScript type definitions in src/lib/types.ts (Task, DailyMetric, UserPreferences interfaces)
- [ ] T010 [P] Initialize Supabase client in src/api/supabase.ts with environment configuration
- [ ] T011 [P] Setup chrome.storage.sync utilities in src/lib/storage.ts (get, set, clear, quota management)

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - user story implementation can now begin in parallel

---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Quick Task Capture (Priority: P1) üéØ MVP

**Goal**: Users can quickly add tasks whenever they open a new browser tab, capturing to-dos immediately without switching contexts

- [ ] T032 [US1] Add input validation (non-empty title, max 500 characters)
- [ ] T033 [US1] Add error handling for storage quota and network issues

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Story 1 should be fully functional and testable independently

---

## Phase 4: User Story 2 - Task Completion Tracking (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Users can mark tasks as complete to track their progress and build a history of accomplished work

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by adding several tasks, marking some as complete, and verifying that completed tasks are visually distinguished and tracked separately

- [ ] T037 [P] [US2] Style CompletedTaskToggle component in src/components/task/CompletedTaskToggle.css.ts
- [ ] T038 [US2] Extend task API functions in src/api/tasks.ts (updateTask for completion status)
- [ ] T039 [US2] Create TanStack Query hooks in src/hooks/useTaskQuery.ts (useUpdateTaskMutation)
- [ ] T040 [US2] Update taskStore.ts to handle task completion state and toggle visibility
- [ ] T041 [US2] Update Task interface in src/lib/types.ts to include completed_at timestamp
- [ ] T042 [US2] Implement task completion/uncompletion workflow with optimistic updates
- [ ] T043 [US2] Add completed tasks visibility toggle in NewTab.tsx page
- [ ] T044 [US2] Update TaskList component to filter completed tasks based on toggle state
- [ ] T045 [US2] Implement completion timestamp tracking in Supabase via database triggers
- [ ] T046 [US2] Add visual distinction for completed vs active tasks in UI
- [ ] T047 [US2] Update chrome.storage.sync to persist completion state and toggle preference

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Stories 1 AND 2 should both work independently

---

## Phase 5: User Story 3 - Progress Visualization Dashboard (Priority: P3)

**Goal**: Users can view visual representations of their task completion patterns and productivity trends

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by creating and completing multiple tasks over time, then viewing the dashboard to verify that visualizations accurately reflect task completion data

### Implementation for User Story 3

- [ ] T048 [P] [US3] Create MetricsCard component in src/components/dashboard/MetricsCard.tsx for stat display

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3+)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 ‚Üí P2 ‚Üí P3)
- **Polish (Final Phase)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Builds on US1 components but independently testable
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Uses task data from US1/US2 but independently testable

### Within Each User Story

- React components before integration
- API functions before query hooks
- Query hooks before component integration
- Core implementation before optimization
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- Once Foundational phase completes, all user stories can start in parallel (if team capacity allows)
- Component creation and styling within each story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Different user stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch all UI components for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Create TaskInput component in src/components/task/TaskInput.tsx"
Task: "Create TaskItem component in src/components/task/TaskItem.tsx"
Task: "Create TaskList component in src/components/task/TaskList.tsx"
Task: "Create EmptyState component in src/components/ui/EmptyState.tsx"

# Launch all styling for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Style TaskInput component with vanilla-extract in src/components/task/TaskInput.css.ts"
Task: "Style TaskItem component with vanilla-extract in src/components/task/TaskItem.css.ts"
Task: "Style TaskList component with vanilla-extract in src/components/task/TaskList.css.ts"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently
5. Deploy/demo if ready

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (MVP!)
3. Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
4. Add User Story 3 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
5. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1
   - Developer B: User Story 2
   - Developer C: User Story 3
3. Stories complete and integrate independently

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Chrome extension requires Manifest V3 compliance (CSP, service worker)
- Hybrid storage: chrome.storage.sync (local cache) + Supabase (source of truth)
- Focus on performance: new tab must load <500ms, operations <100ms
- Tests not included per feature specification requirements
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
