# Specification Quality Checklist: Page Markup with Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-20
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Content Quality - PASS ✅

- **No implementation details**: While Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui are mentioned as constraints (from user requirements), the spec describes WHAT needs to be styled/built, not HOW technically (no specific class names, component implementations, or code structure)
- **User value focused**: All user stories describe user needs and benefits
- **Non-technical language**: Requirements describe visible outcomes and user interactions
- **All sections complete**: User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria all filled

### Requirement Completeness - PASS ✅

- **No clarifications needed**: All requirements are specific and actionable
- **Testable requirements**: Each FR can be verified (e.g., "MUST display hero section" can be tested by viewing the page)
- **Measurable success criteria**: All SC items include specific metrics (time, screen sizes, contrast ratios)
- **Technology-agnostic SC**: Success criteria focus on user experience outcomes, not technical implementation
- **Acceptance scenarios defined**: Each user story has Given-When-Then scenarios
- **Edge cases identified**: 6 edge cases documented covering screen sizes, content variations, sidebar behavior, and degradation
- **Clear scope**: Feature boundaries are well-defined (4 pages, UI markup only, no new data entities)
- **Assumptions documented**: 7 assumptions listed covering existing infrastructure

### Feature Readiness - PASS ✅

- **Clear acceptance criteria**: Each functional requirement is specific and verifiable
- **Primary flows covered**: Landing page → Sign-in → Dashboard flow plus OAuth redirect handling
- **Measurable outcomes**: 8 success criteria with specific metrics
- **No implementation leaks**: Spec focuses on user-facing outcomes

## Overall Assessment

**Status**: ✅ READY FOR PLANNING

All checklist items pass. The specification is complete, unambiguous, and ready for `/speckit.plan` to generate implementation planning documentation.

## Notes

- The mention of "Tailwind CSS" and "shadcn/ui" in requirements (FR-010, FR-011) reflects the user's explicit request for these technologies as design constraints, not implementation details
- Assumptions section properly documents existing infrastructure to clarify scope boundaries
- No clarification questions needed - all requirements have reasonable defaults based on modern web application standards

## Update History

- **2025-10-20**: Dashboard layout changed from single-column to sidebar navigation layout (desktop-focused with responsive collapse)
  - Updated FR-006, FR-007 (split into FR-007 and FR-007a)
  - Updated User Story 3 acceptance scenarios (5 scenarios now instead of 4)
  - Updated SC-004 to clarify sidebar/content distinction
  - Added edge case for sidebar behavior at tablet breakpoint
