# API Contracts

This feature is UI/presentation layer only and does not define any API contracts.

All data interactions use existing Supabase authentication APIs, which are already configured and documented by Supabase.

## Existing API Dependencies

- **Supabase Auth API**: OAuth authentication flow (already configured)
- **Supabase Session Management**: Session retrieval and validation (already configured)

No new API endpoints or contracts are introduced by this feature.
