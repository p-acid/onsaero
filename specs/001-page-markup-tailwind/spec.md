### Session 2025-10-20

- Q: Landing Page Call-to-Action Behavior - Where should the primary CTA button navigate? → A: Navigate to sign-in page (require authentication before dashboard access)

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Landing Page Marketing Experience (Priority: P1)

As a first-time visitor, I want to see an attractive landing page that explains what Onsaero offers so I can understand the product value and decide to sign up.

**Why this priority**: The landing page is the first touchpoint for new users and drives conversion. Without a professional, well-designed landing page, users won't understand the product value or be motivated to sign up.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by navigating to the root URL and verifying all marketing content, features, and call-to-action buttons are visible and properly styled. Delivers immediate value by presenting the product professionally.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user visits the landing page, **When** the page loads, **Then** they see a hero section with product name, tagline, and primary call-to-action button that directs to sign-in
2. **Given** a user scrolls down the landing page, **When** they view the features section, **Then** they see 3 feature cards with icons, titles, and descriptions
3. **Given** a user views the landing page, **When** they look for navigation, **Then** they see clear options to sign in or get started
4. **Given** a user views the landing page on mobile, **When** the page renders, **Then** all content is responsive and readable without horizontal scrolling

### User Story 2 - Sign-In Authentication Flow (Priority: P2)

As a returning user, I want to see a clean, simple sign-in page where I can authenticate using OAuth providers so I can access my task dashboard securely.

**Why this priority**: Authentication is essential for accessing the main application. A well-designed sign-in page builds trust and makes the authentication process straightforward. This is P2 because it depends on landing page directing users here.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by navigating directly to the sign-in page and verifying the OAuth login buttons are properly styled, centered, and functional. Delivers value by providing secure access to the application.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user visits the sign-in page, **When** the page loads, **Then** they see the product logo, tagline, and authentication options centered on screen
2. **Given** a user views the sign-in page, **When** they look for login methods, **Then** they see clearly labeled OAuth provider buttons
3. **Given** a user is on the sign-in page on mobile, **When** the page renders, **Then** the login form is centered and sized appropriately for touch interaction
4. **Given** a user hovers over an OAuth button, **When** the cursor enters the button area, **Then** they see a visual hover state indicating interactivity

### User Story 3 - Dashboard Task Management Interface (Priority: P3)

As an authenticated user, I want to see a clean, organized dashboard where I can view my tasks, track progress, and manage my productivity so I can stay on top of my work.

**Why this priority**: The dashboard is the core application interface where users spend most of their time. A well-designed dashboard improves usability and user satisfaction. This is P3 because it requires authentication to be working first.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by authenticating and verifying the dashboard displays navigation, task areas, and action buttons with proper spacing and visual hierarchy. Delivers value by providing an organized workspace for task management.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an authenticated user visits the dashboard on desktop, **When** the page loads, **Then** they see a sidebar navigation on the left and main content area on the right
2. **Given** a user views the dashboard, **When** they look for navigation, **Then** they see a sidebar with navigation links and a logout button
3. **Given** a user views the dashboard, **When** they look for task areas, **Then** they see task management sections in the main content area
4. **Given** a user clicks the logout button, **When** the action completes, **Then** they are redirected to the sign-in page
5. **Given** a user views the dashboard on tablet or mobile, **When** the page renders, **Then** the sidebar collapses and navigation adapts to a mobile-friendly format (hamburger menu or bottom nav)

### User Story 4 - OAuth Redirect Processing (Priority: P2)

As a user completing OAuth authentication, I want to see a loading state while my authentication is being processed so I understand the system is working and I'm being securely logged in.

**Why this priority**: OAuth redirect handling is part of the authentication flow critical path. A proper loading state prevents user confusion during the redirect process. Shares P2 priority with sign-in as part of the auth experience.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by triggering an OAuth callback URL and verifying the loading indicator appears with appropriate messaging. Delivers value by providing feedback during authentication processing.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user returns from OAuth provider, **When** they land on the redirect page, **Then** they see a centered loading indicator with status text
2. **Given** authentication tokens are valid, **When** processing completes, **Then** the user is redirected to the dashboard
3. **Given** authentication fails, **When** an error occurs, **Then** the user is redirected to the sign-in page
4. **Given** a user views the redirect page, **When** the page loads, **Then** the loading state is visually consistent with the application's design system

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a page is viewed on very small screens (320px width)?
- How does the system handle missing or broken images/icons?
- What happens when content is longer than expected (e.g., very long feature descriptions)?
- How does the layout respond to browser zoom levels (150%, 200%)?
- What happens when JavaScript is disabled (graceful degradation)?
- How does the dashboard sidebar behave during the tablet breakpoint (768px-1023px) - does it overlay or push content?

## Key Entities

This feature focuses on UI/presentation layer and does not introduce new data entities. It enhances the visual presentation of existing pages that interact with:

- **User**: Already defined entity for authentication
- **Session**: Already defined entity for auth state management
- **Tasks**: Existing entity that will be displayed in dashboard (not modified by this feature)
