# Tasks: Page Markup with Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-page-markup-tailwind/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required), research.md (component decisions), quickstart.md (testing guide)

**Tests**: This feature does not include automated tests. Manual testing will be performed using the checklist in quickstart.md.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story (P1 ‚Üí P3) to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3, US4)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- **Shared package pages**: `packages/shared/src/pages/[page]/ui/`
- **Shared package UI**: `packages/shared/src/shared/ui/`
- **Web app pages**: `apps/web/src/pages/[page]/ui/`

---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Landing Page Marketing Experience (Priority: P1) üéØ MVP

**Goal**: Create professional landing page with hero section, 3 feature cards, and navigation

**Independent Test**: Navigate to root URL (http://localhost:5173/) and verify hero section, 3 feature cards, and sign-in navigation are visible and properly styled across mobile (320px), tablet (768px), and desktop (1024px+) viewports

- [ ] T016 [US1] Add focus-visible styles to CTA button and navigation links in packages/shared/src/pages/landing/ui/index.tsx

**Checkpoint**: Landing page is fully functional. Test independently at 320px, 768px, 1024px viewports before proceeding.

---

## Phase 4: User Story 2 - Sign-In Authentication Flow (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Create clean, centered sign-in page with OAuth buttons and branding

**Independent Test**: Navigate to /sign-in and verify product logo, tagline, and OAuth buttons are centered and properly styled across all viewports

### Implementation for User Story 2

- [ ] T017 [P] [US2] Implement centered layout with flexbox (flex min-h-screen items-center justify-center) in packages/shared/src/pages/sign-in/ui/index.tsx

## Phase 5: User Story 4 - OAuth Redirect Processing (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Enhanced loading state during OAuth callback processing

**Independent Test**: Trigger OAuth callback URL and verify centered spinner with Korean text "Î°úÍ∑∏Ïù∏ Ï§ëÏûÖÎãàÎã§..." appears immediately

**Note**: This story is implemented before Dashboard (US3) because it shares P2 priority with Sign-In and is simpler

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-6)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User Story 1 (P1 - Landing): Can start after Foundational (independent, no dependencies)
  - User Story 2 (P2 - Sign-In): Can start after Foundational (independent, no dependencies)
  - User Story 4 (P2 - Redirect): Can start after Foundational (independent, no dependencies)
  - User Story 3 (P3 - Dashboard): Can start after Foundational (independent, no dependencies)
- **Polish (Phase 7)**: Depends on all user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1 - Landing)**: Independent - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2 - Sign-In)**: Independent - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 4 (P2 - Redirect)**: Independent - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 3 (P3 - Dashboard)**: Independent - No dependencies on other stories

**Key Insight**: All user stories are independent and can be implemented in parallel by different team members after Phase 2 completes.

### Within Each User Story

- Landing (US1): Tasks T009-T016 are mostly sequential (each builds on page structure)
- Sign-In (US2): Tasks T017-T018 parallel, T019-T023 mostly sequential
- Redirect (US4): Tasks T024-T025 parallel, T026-T028 sequential
- Dashboard (US3): Tasks T029-T030 parallel (create files), T031-T045 sequential (build sidebar ‚Üí integrate)

### Parallel Opportunities

- Phase 1 Setup: All tasks (T001-T003) can run in parallel (different shadcn/ui components)
- Phase 2 Foundational: Tasks T007-T008 can run in parallel
- User Story 1: Tasks T011 (feature cards) can be developed in parallel with T009-T010 (hero section)
- User Story 2: Tasks T017-T018 can run in parallel (layout + branding)
- User Story 4: Tasks T024-T025 can run in parallel (spinner + layout)
- User Story 3: Tasks T029-T030 can run in parallel (create Sidebar and MobileNav files)
- Phase 7 Polish: All validation tasks (T046-T057) can run in parallel

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1 (Landing Page)

```bash
# Create hero section and feature cards in parallel:
Task: T009 - Implement hero section with product name, tagline, and CTA
Task: T011 - Implement 3 feature cards using Card component
# Both work on same file but different sections, can merge easily

# After both complete, continue with:
Task: T010 - Configure CTA button navigation
Task: T012 - Add responsive layout for cards
Task: T013 - Implement header navigation
Task: T014 - Add dark mode support
Task: T015 - Add semantic HTML structure
Task: T016 - Add focus-visible styles
```

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 3 (Dashboard)

```bash
# Create component files in parallel:
Task: T029 - Create Sidebar component file
Task: T030 - Create MobileNav component file

# Implement components in parallel (different files):
Task: T031 - Implement Sidebar navigation links
Task: T034 - Implement MobileNav with Sheet component
# Both can proceed simultaneously

# After both components complete:
Task: T037 - Integrate Sidebar and MobileNav into dashboard page
Task: T038 - Add responsive breakpoint logic
# Then continue with remaining tasks sequentially
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

**Minimum Viable Product**: Landing page with hero and feature cards

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (install shadcn/ui components)
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (install Lucide React)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (Landing Page)
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test landing page independently
   - Navigate to http://localhost:5173/
   - Verify hero section, 3 feature cards, navigation visible
   - Test at 320px, 768px, 1024px viewports
   - Test keyboard navigation (Tab to CTA, Enter navigates)
   - Test dark mode toggle (if implemented)
5. Deploy/demo if ready - Landing page provides immediate value!

### Incremental Delivery (Recommended)

**Strategy**: Add one user story at a time, validate independently

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 (Landing) ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (**MVP!**)
3. Add User Story 2 (Sign-In) ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
4. Add User Story 4 (Redirect) ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
5. Add User Story 3 (Dashboard) ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
6. Complete Polish phase ‚Üí Final validation ‚Üí Production release

Each story adds value without breaking previous stories.

### Parallel Team Strategy

**With multiple developers**, maximize throughput:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together (6 tasks, ~30 minutes)
2. Once Foundational is done, split work:
   - **Developer A**: User Story 1 (Landing) - 8 tasks
   - **Developer B**: User Story 2 (Sign-In) + User Story 4 (Redirect) - 12 tasks
   - **Developer C**: User Story 3 (Dashboard) - 17 tasks
3. Stories complete and integrate independently
4. Team validates together in Phase 7 (Polish)

**Estimated Timeline**:
- Setup + Foundational: 30-60 minutes
- User Story 1: 2-3 hours
- User Story 2 + 4: 2-3 hours (combined)
- User Story 3: 4-5 hours (most complex with sidebar)
- Polish: 1-2 hours
- **Total**: 10-14 hours (sequential) or 5-7 hours (3 developers in parallel)

---

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files or independent sections, can run in parallel
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story is independently completable and testable
- Manual testing replaces automated tests (see quickstart.md checklist)
- Commit after each completed user story phase
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Avoid: modifying same file section simultaneously, skipping validation checkpoints

---

## Task Count Summary

- **Total Tasks**: 58
- **Setup (Phase 1)**: 6 tasks
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: 2 tasks
- **User Story 1 (P1 - Landing)**: 8 tasks
- **User Story 2 (P2 - Sign-In)**: 7 tasks
- **User Story 4 (P2 - Redirect)**: 5 tasks
- **User Story 3 (P3 - Dashboard)**: 17 tasks
- **Polish (Phase 7)**: 13 tasks

**Parallel Opportunities**: 21 tasks marked with [P] can run in parallel when dependencies allow

**Independent Test Criteria**: Each user story has clear checkpoints for independent validation before proceeding
