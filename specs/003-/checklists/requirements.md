# Specification Quality Checklist: Authentication Gate for Main Service

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-13
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: ✅ PASSED

All checklist items have been validated successfully. The specification is complete and ready for the next phase.

### Details

**Content Quality**:
- ✅ Specification focuses on WHAT and WHY without HOW
- ✅ No framework, language, or API references found
- ✅ Written in business-friendly language

**Requirement Completeness**:
- ✅ All 10 functional requirements are testable
- ✅ All 6 success criteria include specific metrics (percentages, time limits)
- ✅ Success criteria use user-facing language (e.g., "users can access", "100% of attempts")
- ✅ 4 prioritized user stories with acceptance scenarios
- ✅ 6 edge cases identified covering session management, multi-tab scenarios, and browser history
- ✅ Scope clearly defined in "Out of Scope" section
- ✅ 6 assumptions documented
- ✅ 3 dependencies identified

**Feature Readiness**:
- ✅ Each user story includes independent test criteria
- ✅ User stories prioritized (P1, P2, P3) with rationale
- ✅ All scenarios follow Given-When-Then format
- ✅ Measurable outcomes align with functional requirements

## Notes

The specification is comprehensive and ready for `/speckit.plan` or `/speckit.clarify`. No clarifications needed as the authentication gate pattern follows industry-standard practices with reasonable defaults applied.
