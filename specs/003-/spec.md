# Feature Specification: Authentication Gate for Main Service

**Feature Branch**: `003-`
**Created**: 2025-10-13
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "로그인이 되지 않은 상태면, 메인 서비스에 접근하지 못하게 해줘"

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-13

- Q: When a user logs out in one browser tab, should other open tabs with the same session immediately detect the logout and redirect to login, or only redirect when the user interacts with them? → A: Immediate detection - All tabs detect logout within 5 seconds and auto-redirect
- Q: Which specific routes should be accessible without authentication (public)? → A: Only login page and root landing page (/) are public, all else protected
- Q: When the authentication service is unavailable or fails to respond, should the system fail closed (block all access) or fail open (allow temporary access)? → A: Fail closed - Block all protected route access, show service unavailable message
- Q: Which session storage mechanism should be used for authentication state? → A: HTTP-only secure cookies (auto-syncs across tabs, XSS-protected)
- Q: During the authentication check (before rendering protected content), what should users see? → A: Loading skeleton or spinner during auth validation (typical 100-500ms)

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Redirect Unauthenticated Users to Login (Priority: P1)

When an unauthenticated user attempts to access any page within the main service, they are automatically redirected to the login page to authenticate before gaining access.

**Why this priority**: This is the core security requirement that prevents unauthorized access to the application. Without this, the entire authentication system is meaningless.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by clearing session/cookies and attempting to access any main service URL. Success means immediate redirect to login page without showing protected content.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user has no active session, **When** user navigates to main service URL, **Then** user is redirected to login page
2. **Given** user has no active session, **When** user attempts direct URL access to protected page, **Then** user is redirected to login page without seeing protected content
3. **Given** user has no active session, **When** user is redirected to login, **Then** original destination URL is preserved for post-login redirect

### User Story 2 - Allow Authenticated Users to Access Main Service (Priority: P1)

When an authenticated user accesses the main service, they can view and interact with all protected content without interruption.

**Why this priority**: This validates that the authentication gate works correctly for valid users. Without this, the gate would block everyone.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by logging in with valid credentials and accessing various main service pages. Success means seamless access without repeated login prompts.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user has valid active session, **When** user navigates to main service, **Then** user sees protected content immediately
2. **Given** user has valid active session, **When** user navigates between protected pages, **Then** user maintains access without re-authentication
3. **Given** user has valid active session, **When** user refreshes protected page, **Then** user remains authenticated and sees content

---

### User Story 3 - Graceful Handling of Session Expiration (Priority: P2)

When an authenticated user's session expires while using the main service, they are redirected to login with clear messaging about session expiration.

**Why this priority**: This provides better user experience by clearly communicating why access was lost and allowing users to resume their work after re-authentication.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by simulating session expiration (time-based or manual invalidation) during active use. Success means clear notification and return to original page after re-login.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user has active session that expires, **When** user performs any action, **Then** user sees session expiration message and is redirected to login
2. **Given** user session expired, **When** user re-authenticates, **Then** user is redirected back to page they were on before expiration
3. **Given** user session expired, **When** user is on login page, **Then** clear message indicates session timeout (not generic login prompt)

---

### User Story 4 - Public Page Access Without Authentication (Priority: P3)

Users can access the root landing page (/) and login page without requiring authentication, while all other routes in the main service remain protected.

**Why this priority**: This allows the application to serve essential public content (landing page for marketing/user acquisition, login for authentication) while protecting all main service functionality. Lower priority as it's not critical for security.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by accessing / and /login URLs without authentication. Success means these pages load normally while all other routes redirect to login.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user has no active session, **When** user accesses root landing page (/), **Then** page loads without authentication
2. **Given** user has no active session, **When** user accesses login page, **Then** page loads without authentication
3. **Given** user has no active session, **When** user clicks link from landing page to any protected route, **Then** user is redirected to login
4. **Given** user is authenticated, **When** user accesses root landing page, **Then** page loads with authenticated navigation context (e.g., showing user menu or dashboard link)

### Edge Cases

- When user opens multiple tabs and logs out in one tab, all other tabs must detect the logout within 5 seconds and automatically redirect to login page
- When authentication service is unavailable or fails to respond, system blocks all protected route access and displays service unavailable message (fail closed)
- Direct API calls without valid session tokens are rejected with 401 Unauthorized response
- During authentication validation (100-500ms), users see loading skeleton or spinner to indicate progress
- What happens when user's session is invalidated server-side (e.g., password change, account suspension)?
- How does system handle race conditions between session validation and page rendering?
- What happens when user uses browser back button after logout?
- How does system handle authentication state in different browser contexts (incognito mode, different browsers)?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST block all access to main service pages for users without valid authentication session
- **FR-002**: System MUST redirect unauthenticated users to login page when accessing protected routes
- **FR-003**: System MUST preserve intended destination URL during authentication redirect for post-login navigation
- **FR-004**: System MUST validate authentication state before rendering any protected page content
- **FR-005**: System MUST allow authenticated users to access all main service functionality without repeated authentication prompts
- **FR-006**: System MUST handle session expiration by redirecting to login with appropriate messaging
- **FR-007**: System MUST distinguish between public routes (root landing page / and login page only) and protected routes (all other paths requiring authentication)
- **FR-008**: System MUST prevent caching of protected content in browser history for logged-out users
- **FR-009**: System MUST maintain consistent authentication state across all browser tabs for same user session, detecting logout/invalidation within 5 seconds and triggering automatic redirect
- **FR-010**: System MUST validate authentication on both initial page load and client-side route transitions
- **FR-011**: System MUST fail closed when authentication service is unavailable, blocking all protected route access and displaying service unavailable message
- **FR-012**: System MUST use HTTP-only secure cookies for session storage to enable automatic cross-tab synchronization and XSS protection
- **FR-013**: System MUST display loading skeleton or spinner during authentication validation before rendering protected page content

### Key Entities

- **Authentication Session**: Represents user's logged-in state, includes validity period, user identifier, and creation timestamp
- **Protected Route**: Main service page or functionality requiring authentication, includes URL pattern and access rules
- **Public Route**: Routes accessible without authentication - specifically root landing page (/) and login page only

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: 100% of unauthenticated access attempts to protected routes result in redirect to login page
- **SC-002**: Authenticated users can access protected routes in under 500ms without additional authentication prompts
- **SC-003**: Users are redirected back to their intended destination within 2 seconds after successful login
- **SC-004**: Zero instances of protected content visible to unauthenticated users in browser inspection or network traffic
- **SC-005**: Session expiration is detected and handled within 5 seconds of occurrence
- **SC-006**: 95% of users successfully navigate to protected content after authentication on first attempt

## Assumptions *(mandatory)*

- Authentication mechanism (login system) already exists and provides session validation
- Clear distinction exists between "main service" routes and public pages
- Browser supports HTTP-only secure cookies with SameSite attribute
- Users expect standard web application authentication patterns (redirect-based flow)
- Session validation can be performed synchronously or asynchronously before page render
- System uses industry-standard session timeout duration (typically 30 minutes to 24 hours)

## Dependencies *(optional)*

- Existing authentication system must provide session validation API
- Routing system must support authentication guards/middleware
- Login page must exist and be accessible to unauthenticated users

## Out of Scope *(optional)*

- Implementation of new login/authentication mechanisms (assumes existing system)
- Password reset or account recovery flows
- Multi-factor authentication
- Remember me / persistent login functionality
- OAuth or social login integration
- Role-based access control within authenticated areas (separate authorization feature)
- API authentication patterns (assumes this feature focuses on web page access)
